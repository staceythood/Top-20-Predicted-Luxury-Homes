# Top-20-Predicted-Luxury-Homes


FINAL PROJECT â€“ RECOMMENDATION OF TOP 20 LUXURIOUS HOMES


**1.1 Objective**

To recommend for investment the purchase of the twenty (20) most luxurious (i.e. priciest) homes out of 100 candidate properties for which the sales prices are not known.

**1.2 Background and the Goal**

Our group acted as a set of investors who plan to purchase 20 residential properties in the city where the raw data files were collected. The broker of the properties gave us a list of 100 properties and their information, consisting of many assessed values for them. However, this data set did not contain the final sale prices or a couple of other variables. We developed models and appropriate procedures to predict and rank the sale price and recommend the 20 most luxurious houses. The reason for investing in the top luxury houses is that their potential investment growth is believed to be the greatest.

**1.3 Results**

Among the actual top-20 houses, our team predicted 17 correctly (85% hit). Among the remaining 3 of our nominated houses, all of them ranked in the actual top-40. All 5 of the actual top-5 houses were in our list of 20.
